# how to use
> you can let me to create all html elements for you  , but its better to create your container  elements and put them where you want and style them like a charm , so  
create your html like this :
```sh
<!-- container for SearchBox  -->
<div class="searchContainer"> </div>
<!--container for page size selectbox -->
<div class="pageSizeContainer"></div>
<!--container for pagination -->
<div class="paginationContainer "></div>
<!--container for awesomeTable -->
 <div class="awesomeTableContiner"> </div>
```
its done , then put this before End tag for body , like this :
```sh
<!-- including lib script  -->
<script src="awesomeTableJs.js"></script>
<script>
//initial table
var aweTbl = new awesomeTableJs({
// a json file or a websrvice that return JSON as its results
// url : 'http://yourUrl/webserviceOrPageOrFileThatReturnJSON'
url:'example.json',
//how many records should display per table page
  pageSize:10,
// table container div
  tableWrapper:".awesomeTableContiner",
// pagination container div
  paginationWrapper:".paginationContainer",
// searchbox container div
  searchboxWrapper:".searchContainer",
// pagesize selectbox div
  pageSizeWrapper:".pageSizeContainer"
});
// then call Awesomeness and wait for it ...
aweTbl.createTable();
</script>
```

here is an expected JSON (your json should looklike this):
```sh
[
    ...
    ...
    {
      "index": 0,
      "isActive": false,
      "picture": "http://placehold.it/32x32",
      "age": 24,
      "name": "Rosalinda Monroe",
      "gender": "female",
      "email": "rosalindamonroe@equitax.com",
      "registered": "2014-02-07",
      .. (more)
    },
      "index": 1,
      "isActive": true,
      "picture": "http://placehold.it/32x32",
      "age": 35,
      "name": "Sharon Schwartz",
      "gender": "female",
